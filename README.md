# engg-3130-final
Final project ideas for ENGG*3130

Our idea for our final project is to teach a computer to play a classic video using a reinforcement learning
model. The current game we are thinking about is tetris.

The objective of our project is to analyze the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in the same enviroment.

To create the necessary environment you must first install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 which can be found here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16
