# engg-3130-final
Final project for ENGG*3130

This project focuses on deep reinforcement learning. Specifically deep Q learning algorithms being used in the classic arcade games of Tetris, Pong, and Space Invaders. Deep-Q learning is a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a policy telling an agent what action to take under what circumstances. Typically deep reinforcement learning algorithms outperform more traditional methods in both processing and performance. In this project we found the Deep-Q learning will produce very different results in different games

To create the necessary environment you must first install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools for Visual Studio which can be found here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
