Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

The Autonomous Learning Library requires a recent version of Pytorch (>= 10.3).
Additionally, Tensorboard is required in order to enable logging.
We recommond installing these through `Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_.
We also strongly recommend using a machine with a fast GPU (a GTX 970 or better).

Installation
------------

The ``autonomous-learning-library`` can be installed from PyPi using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install autonomous-learning-library

If you're lazy, you can install the prerequisites as well using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install autonomous-learning-library[pytorch]

An alternate approach, that may be useful when following this tutorial, is to instead install by cloning the Github repository:

    git clone https://github.com/cpnota/autonomous-learning-library.git
    cd autonomous-learning-library
    pip install -e .

You can test your installation by running the tests::

    make test

This should also tell you if CUDA (the GPU driver) is unavailable.

Running a Preset Agent
----------------------

The goal of the Autonomous Learning Library is to be a library for building new agents.
However, the library includes a number of "preset" agent configurations for easy benchmarking and comparison.
It also includes some useful scripts for running the presets.
For example, an A2C agent can be run on Cart-Pole as follows::

    python scripts/classic.py CartPole-v0 ppo

The results will be written to ``runs/_a2c <id>``, where ``<id>`` is some some string generated by the library.
You can view these results and other information through `tensorboard`:

    tensorboard --logdir runs

By opening your browser to <http://localhost:6006>, you should see a dashboard that looks something like the following (you may need to adjust the "smoothing" parameter):

.. image:: tensorboard.png

If you want to compare agents in a nicer, format, you can use the `plot` script::

    python scripts/plot.py runs

This should give you a plot similar to the following:

.. image:: plot.png

In this plot, each point represents the average of the episodic returns over the last 100 episodes.
The shaded region represents the standard deviation over that interval.

Finally, to watch the trained model in action, we provide a `watch` scripts for each preset module::

    python scripts/watch_classic.py CartPole-v0 "runs/_a2c <id>"

You need to find the <id> by checking the ``runs`` directory.

Be sure to check out the `atari` and `continuous` presets for more fun!
